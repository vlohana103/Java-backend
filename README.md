🚀 D288 – Back-End Programming

Java Backend / Spring Boot API – Western Governors University

📘 Overview

This project is part of D288 – Back-End Programming, where students design and build a full Java-based backend connected to a relational database and an Angular frontend.

Throughout the project, you develop a Spring Boot REST API that performs CRUD operations, integrates with MySQL, and follows object-oriented design principles and industry patterns.

This project emphasizes real-world backend development:
✔ REST endpoints
✔ Spring Boot framework
✔ Database integration
✔ Services, repositories, controllers
✔ DTOs and model mapping
✔ Exception handling
✔ Unit testing
✔ Integration with an Angular UI

🎯 Project Objectives
✔ Object-Oriented Design

Implement classes using encapsulation and inheritance

Apply common design patterns (Repository, Service Layer, DTO mapping)

Use interfaces for clean architecture

✔ Spring Boot API

Build REST endpoints with Spring Web

Route HTTP requests to controllers

Use services for business logic

Use repositories for database operations

Create domain models / entities

✔ Database Integration

Connect to a MySQL database

Map entities using JPA/Hibernate

Perform CRUD via JPA repositories

Use relationships such as:

One-to-Many

Many-to-One

Many-to-Many (if required by your implementation)

✔ Angular Frontend Connection

The Spring Boot API provides JSON responses consumed by a provided Angular app

Endpoints support UI functionality such as listing, creating, editing, and deleting data

✔ Validation & Exception Handling

Input validation (Bean Validation / @Valid)

Custom exception responses

Error codes for invalid or missing data

✔ Lab Environment

The project was built using:

IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

Java 17+

Spring Boot

MySQL

Angular Front-End (Provided by WGU)

The backend runs in a WGU lab environment but can also be cloned locally.

Connecting Java applications to relational databases

Understanding repositories, services, and controllers

Layered application architecture

Building API endpoints consumed by a front-end

Using IntelliJ and MySQL Workbench effectively

Applying Java OOP principles in a backend environment

Using Git and branching workflows in GitLab

Debugging integration between front-end and backend systems
